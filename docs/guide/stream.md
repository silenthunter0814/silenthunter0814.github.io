# Stream ciphers

***Stream ciphers are completely broken and will be removed soon. New users must use [AEAD ciphers](/guide/aead).***

## Stream Encryption/Decryption

Stream_encrypt is a function that takes a secret key, an initialization vector, a message, and produces a ciphertext with the same length as the message.

```
Stream_encrypt(key, IV, message) => ciphertext
```

Stream_decrypt is a function that takes a secret key, an initializaiton vector, a ciphertext, and produces the original message.

```
Stream_decrypt(key, IV, ciphertext) => message
```

The key can be input directly from user or generated from a password. The key derivation is following `EVP_BytesToKey(3)` in OpenSSL. The detailed spec can be found here: https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Manual:EVP_BytesToKey(3)

## TCP

A stream cipher encrypted TCP stream starts with a randomly generated initializaiton vector, followed by encrypted payload data.

```
[IV][encrypted payload]
```

## UDP

A stream cipher encrypted UDP packet has the following structure

```
[IV][encrypted payload]
```

 Each UDP packet is encrypted/decrypted independently with a randomly generated initialization vector.
