# What is SIP

SIP stands for Shadowsocks Improvement Proposal. SIPs are standards specifying potential new features or processes for Shadowsocks.

## How to submit a SIP?

Shadowsocks is a community open to any reasonable improvements. To submit a SIP, please open a SIP issue on our GitHub [issue tracker](https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-org/issues).

## When will a SIP be accepted?

If most of the core contributors agree to accept a SIP, a formal SIP document will be published on this site. All the developers will review and follow the SIP to implement their own implementations. The whole process usually takes months.
